# App Description
I made this app as a test for hiring in a company, using node.js as backend, and React native as frontend.

The product is a Sketching App for contractors. The user of the App is a contractor/builder who goes to houses to build fences in the backyard/garden, by first drawing them on the App (using touch screen by finger), showing them to the customer, then approving them and saving them on the database with the customer details.

- The main screen is a grid view of the customers, showing the details of the customer that I click to take me to the View screen of that customer. And a button to create new customers at the top.

- The new customer screen will have the following fields: Name, Phone, Email, Notes text area. Below it I have a white area to sketch using my finger. Then I click Submit button to save the customer record (the sketch photo will be saved on the cloud (Firebase)).

- A login system, the login credentials is as follows: Username "contractor", Password: "12345".
